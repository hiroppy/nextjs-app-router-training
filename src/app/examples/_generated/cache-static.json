The result is cached and can be pushed to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This optimization allows you to share the result of the rendering work between users and server requests.\n\nStatic rendering is useful when a route has data that is not personalized to the user and can be known at build time, such as a static blog post or a product page.\n    ",
